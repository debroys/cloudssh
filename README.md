# cloudssh
A client tool for ssh into a VM in the public cloud using static instance name.

Initially the tool supports AWS. In the future, we will support other cloud providers. Currently the client tool works on Windows only.

Requirements:

1. Install python 3.
2. Install aws cli tool and go through the configuration process.
3. Install PUTTY. Cloudssh uses PUTTY as its underline ssh client.

Make sure all installed tools are on the path for command search.
